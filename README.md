Simplex OS is a feature-rich, web-based desktop environment built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a playground for exploring UI/UX concepts, demonstrating the power of modern browser capabilities, and creating a persistent, customizable user experience without any backend or frameworks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Interacting with Simplex OS is designed to be intuitive:

1.  **Explore:** Use the **Start Menu** to discover and launch built-in applications.
2.  **Organize:** Right-click on apps in the Start Menu to add shortcuts to your desktop.
3.  **Multitask:** Drag windows by their title bars, resize from the corners, and use the taskbar to switch between open applications.
4.  **Personalize:** Open the **Settings** app to change your wallpaper, theme, and accent colors.
5.  **Expand:** Open the **App Installer** to add new applications from the App Library or your own `.js` files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Your Own Apps

Simplex OS has a simple and powerful API for creating your own custom applications. All you need is a single JavaScript file.

The core of any app is the `simplexOS_AppConfig` object, where you define its name, icon, and initialization logic.

```javascript
// MyAwesomeApp.js
var simplexOS_AppConfig = {
  name: "My Awesome App",
  icon: '<i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>',
  defaultSize: { width: 400, height: 250 },

  init: function(contentEl, windowId) {
    // Your app's HTML and logic goes here
    contentEl.innerHTML = `<h3>Hello from ${this.name}!</h3>`;
  }
};

üíª Running Locally

No complex build process is required to run Simplex OS locally.

Clone the repository:

Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simplex-os.git
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.

Open index.html:
You can open the index.html file directly in your browser. For the best experience and to ensure all features (like the media player's visualizer) work correctly, it's recommended to use a local web server. A great tool for this is the Live Server extension for VS Code.

üí° Future Goals

A simple, abstracted "File System" for apps to read/write from.

More interactive widgets (Weather, RSS Feed).

System-wide keyboard shortcuts.

Improved accessibility and touch-screen interactions.
